\section*{Prerequisites}

\hspace{14pt} First, run ``prerequisites.sh" to install critical requirements.

Or, use ``prerequisites.ps1" for Windows.

Manually running ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt" will be fine, too.

\section*{Environment}

\hspace{13pt} Notice that the assignment has been tested on Python 3.7.4 [Clang 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)] on darwin.

Other Python version later than 3.6 might work, but not for sure.

Python 2 is not supported.

This program was developed and tested on PyQt 5.13.2 (Open-source version).

\section*{Running}

\hspace{14pt} Execute ``run.sh" or ``run.ps1", or manually execute ``src/ConvolutionExample/convolutionexample.py".

\section*{Usage}

\subsection*{Import Image Document}

\hspace{14pt} Select ``File" \- ``Import Image Document" or press Command + O, and pick the image file to be processed.

\subsection*{Select Filter \& Convolve Kernel}

\hspace{14pt} In the variable settings box, pick the ``Usage" pop-up selector and choose what you want.

By using different kernel, you may change the kernel size and the sigma value as provided.

\subsection*{Execute}

\hspace{13pt} Click ``Apply Convolve" or ``Apply Filter" to start the calculation.

Special Notice: In some special environments, the preview panel won't update until the window gets it focus again. So when the processing stops but the preview panel doesn't update, try switching focus to another tasks, and then switch it back. The preview panel should be refreshed then.

\subsection*{Export Image Document}

\hspace{14pt} Select ``File" \- ``Export Image Document" or press Command + S, and pick the path to be saved.
