FFS: Fast File System
Please read Fast File System (PDF), and answer following questions:

What is the problem this paper tried to solve? (Hint: please state the problem using data)
What is the root cause of the problem? In one sentence.
For each optimization, how does the author get the idea? (Hint: just imagine you’re the author. Given the problem, what experiment would you do to get more info?)
For each optimization, does it always work? In which case it cannot work?
Do you have some better ideas to implement a faster FS?
Some guidance of paper reading:

First time: please scan the entire paper for the first time. Read the first sentence of each paragraph and try to understand the logic of the whole article.
Second time: read the paper again carefully. For each optimization, please use one sentence as summary. If you’re not familiar with the tech, just mark and skip it.
Why the old FS is not good enough?
Pay attention to “File System Parameterization”, you may need to read it many times.
For evaluation part, please ask yourself why the author test in this way, and what else do you think should be measured.
Third time: go back and find all the mark places, using Google to find more about the them, try to understand in their context.
Fourth time: selectively read parts of the paper with the questions in mind, and answer them.
Final: read the description of FFS in Remzi's "three easy pieces" (pdf), for better understanding.
The deadline is Sep 30 23:59.

Please write your answer into a text file and upload it to ftp://public.sjtu.edu.cn/upload/reading2/[your-student-id].txt, like 517021910000.txt
